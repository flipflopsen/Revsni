## Introduction

Revsni aka. **REVerse Shell Noteable Impact** aims to be a **Java-Based** Framework like Application for different Types of Command & Control.
Furthermore it should be able to switch between different types of communication and encryption whereas encryption will be nestable and interchangeable.
Last but not least it will implement a builder in order to create different types of payloads and handlers, compatible with the same central server.

## Already implemented

  - Socket based communication between Server and Client through TCP
  - AES encryption in CBC mode

### Shell types (Interchangeable)
  - TCP
  - HTTP
  - Asynchronous HTTP

## Planned

### General

- Builder
  - Payloads
  - Handlers
  - Websites (for authentic HTTP asynchronous stuff)

- Interchangeable shells
- Interchangeable and nestable encryption

### Shell types
  - UDP
  - HTTPS
  - Asynchronous HTTPS
  - DNS

### Encryption
  - RSA
  - SSL (similar)
  - Twofish
  - Serpent
  - Triple DES
  - Blowfish
